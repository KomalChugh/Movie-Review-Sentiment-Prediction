Dataset can be downloaded from : http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/index.html

Important Note : 1) Keep aclImdb folder(can be downloaded from the above link) and python script (assignment1.py) in the same directory.  
		             2) Expected_outputs.txt contains the output for data in test_data_file.txt and train_data_file.txt Use python assignment1.py -f exp for desired results.

How to run the program:

	If you want to use data sampled and saved in file:
	python assignment1.py -f exp
	where exp is the experiment number which can take values 2,3,4,5
	
	If you want to use random data :
	python assignment1.py -r exp
	where exp is the experiment number which can take values 2,3,4,5
  
 These experiment numbers correspond to experiments listed in l1.pdf
